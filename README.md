In this notebook, all the libraries required are included. Therefore, all readers need to do is to run all the chunks and change the CNN structure as they wish.


In chunk CNN model, all the pooling methods we have tried is coded. Please delete the # symbols before the pooling method you want to try, and then put # in front of all the other pooling calls, then run the whole chunk to create CNN.
